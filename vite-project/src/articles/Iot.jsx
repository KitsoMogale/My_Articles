                Calculating things such as velocity, acceleration, temperature, humidity etc requires inputs from dedicated electronic devices.
                Devices such as an arduino are utilized to take in varying input data and compute which operations should be ran to give an output.
                An arduino is like a mini computer, that can be programmed dynamically. The most used programming language is c++ in the programming of an arduino.

             One person may be concerned about having to learn a new programming language after having learned JavaScript. In reality, most programming languages are similar to each other than they are different. Fundamentals such as functions, variables, loops and object are so similar you’d think there is no point in having different programming languages. The main differences occur in syntax, memory management and type of technology intended. Api’s, libraries and backend programming are still applicable regarding the programming of hardware like arduinos.

             Meaning you could still do majority of the programming in a nodesjs server, and decide what should happen when certain input data is received. One person may also ask how a plain electronic device like an arduino can communicate with a server. This is made possible by other electronic devices called sensors or electronic modules.  <br/>
             Internet of Things (IoT) sensors play a crucial role in connecting the physical world to the digital world, enabling a wide range of applications that enhance efficiency, safety, and convenience. Choosing the right sensor and communication protocol depends on the specific requirements of the application, such as range, data rate, power consumption, and environmental conditions.

          <p id='wifi_'>This is a wifi module, it helps the arduino connect to the internet if available. 
            <br/>
          Pros: High data rates, wide coverage.
          Cons: High power consumption, potential interference.

            With these electronic devices, our programming skills can be used in creating robotics, solving problems that require automated input from the physical environment and automating basic tasks such as switching off the house lights when the sun is setting, switching on the heater when temperatures drop below a certain point etc.
