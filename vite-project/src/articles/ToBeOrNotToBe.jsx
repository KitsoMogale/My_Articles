                <p>When deciding to persue a career in software development, in this day and age one has one of two options, go to a recognized university or learn on the internet "How to become a self-taught software developer for beginers".Both paths have their own pro and cons that can sometimes be relative to each individual.</p>
                <p>Making a decision to these career paths,may seem binary, "choose one and let go of one forever",but realistically, the choice is analoguous,"You can choose one and follow the other one later if, and not limited to if, the first one was not as productive as you would have liked or as the economy would have liked.</p>
