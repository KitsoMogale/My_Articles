               <span>W</span>hen looking for employment , software developers in particular, myself included, tend to think companies , whether private or government owned, are obligated to fairly review their status and skills ,and try by all means to give them the job opportunity.
                They have the "backend" idea that companies exist only to serve their needs. This holds to be true to an extent with our fields of employment. That is why you can find people who are already employed , going on a strike for the sake of salary or wage increase. They do this with the mindset that the company can and should serve their needs. <b>Don't get me wrong , I do think fair wages and salaries are of essence when talking about a growing economy</b>, but obligation towards companies shouldn't be the deciding factor.The deciding factor should be the obligation of the job seekers to be equiped with the above average skills.

                For software developers , "job seekers to be equiped with the above average skills" means having a strong <b>Portfolio of Evidence </b>.This includes an impressive github repository catelog of projects, the collaborations you've been invovled in and one of the most important ones is the problem you have sovled in the real world with your skills.
             </p>
             <p>Before you complain or start blaming others for your not being employed status or how much you should be paid if you were to get employed ,put yourself in the position of a company founder who risked a percentage of their money,and potentially other people's money who believed in their vision.These founders put in extra hours to get the company running at a profit or even to just break even.Now imagine the cashflow of the company is gaining momentum and you are able to forecast employment into the company, you then send out a job posting. You receive applications from various individuals with different levels of skills required for the job.Would you feel obliged to employ all of them or if you employ one of them that you should fullfill their every need?I don't think so.
              <span>                 </span>  So why do we , as entry level software developers feel<br/> the need to be spoon fed by these companies?It's unfair to the hustler founders, the economy and our future independent problem solving skills. </p>
